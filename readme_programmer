# Programming conventions

## Variables and types
* Variable names are written in lower case letters.
* Struct and enum type names start with a upper case letter.
* variables with more than one word should be linked by an underscore.
* Any preprocessor directive like a definition should be in all upper case, 
  like EAST for i+1 etc. 
* Any enum items should also be in upper case, like YMIN
